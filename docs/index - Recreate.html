                A tribute to
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3GnJlR9">the book</a> by
                <mark>Oliver Burkeman</mark>, an exploration of time management in the
                face of human finitude, and addressing the anxiety of “getting
                everything done.”

        <h2>Yet a week feels frustratingly limited</h2>
        <p>
            The pressure to be more productive and fit ever-increasing quantities of
            activity into a stubbornly non-increasing quantity of time leads to
            productivity anxiety, shriveled attention spans, and burn-out.

        <h2>And there are alarmingly few of&nbsp;them</h2>
        <p>
            You would feel less anxious about wasting an evening doom-scrolling if
            you had an infinite amount of them. Somehow either doing too much or too
            little can create the sense of wasting time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all this activity we sense there are important and fulfilling
            ways we could be spending our time, even if we can’t say exactly what
            they are. Yet, we systematically spend our time doing other things to
            get by instead.

                I (like many others) felt a wrongness in the world. Life, I knew, was
                supposed to be more joyful than this, more real, more meaningful. We
                were not supposed to hate Mondays and live for the weekends and
                holidays. We were not supposed to have to raise our hands to be
                allowed to pee.

            <h2>The average human life is only <mark>four thousand weeks</mark></h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Scientists estimate that life, in some form, will persist for another
            1.5 billion years or more, until the intensifying heat of the sun
            condemns the last organism to death.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you? Assuming you live to be eighty, you’ll have had about four
            thousand weeks. The rare few lucky enough to become a centenarian will
            see only five thousand.
        </p>
        <p>That’s absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short.</p>
